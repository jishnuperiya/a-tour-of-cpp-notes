## ðŸš€ About the Book

> "_C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly today than I could in C++98._"  
> â€” Bjarne Stroustrup

This book offers a fast-paced overview of modern C++ (C++17 with glimpses into C++20), ideal for programmers who already know another language or earlier versions of C++.
