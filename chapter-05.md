When you make your own class, C++ assumes you want:

A default constructor

A destructor

A copy constructor

A copy assignment operator

A move constructor

A move assignment operator

An equality (==) and inequality (!=) operator

A swap function

But if you want to manage resources (e.g., memory, file handles), you must control how copying and moving happen.

🧪 Let's Build a Class the Wrong Way First
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Data {
    int* ptr;
public:
    Data(int val) {
        ptr = new int(val);
    }
    ~Data() {
        delete ptr;
    }
};
cpp
Copy
Edit
Data a(5);
Data b = a; // ❌ shallow copy — double delete crash!
By default, b = a just copies the pointer, not the actual memory it points to.

✅ Rule of 5: The Correct Way to Write a Resource-Managing Class
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Data {
    int* ptr;
public:
    // Constructor
    Data(int val) : ptr(new int(val)) {}

    // Destructor
    ~Data() { delete ptr; }

    // Copy Constructor
    Data(const Data& other) : ptr(new int(*other.ptr)) {}

    // Copy Assignment
    Data& operator=(const Data& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            *ptr = *other.ptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move Constructor
    Data(Data&& other) noexcept : ptr(other.ptr) {
        other.ptr = nullptr;
    }

    // Move Assignment
    Data& operator=(Data&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete ptr;
            ptr = other.ptr;
            other.ptr = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
🔄 swap() — The Friendly Utility
Swap lets you exchange data between two objects:

cpp
Copy
Edit
void swap(Data& a, Data& b) noexcept {
    using std::swap;
    swap(a.ptr, b.ptr);
}
Why? It's used in:

Assignment

Sorting

std::vector::resize

Exception-safe programming (copy-and-swap idiom)

⚖️ Comparison: == and !=
cpp
Copy
Edit
bool operator==(const Data& a, const Data& b) {
    return *(a.ptr) == *(b.ptr);
}

bool operator!=(const Data& a, const Data& b) {
    return !(a == b);
}
Used in:

std::find

Unit tests

Assertions

📚 Modern Tip: Use = default and = delete
If you don’t want copying:

cpp
Copy
Edit
Data(const Data&) = delete;
Data& operator=(const Data&) = delete;
If you want to say “use compiler-generated version”:

cpp
Copy
Edit
Data(const Data&) = default;
Data& operator=(const Data&) = default;
This is clearer and safer than writing empty bodies.

📌 Summary Table
Operation	Purpose
Copy Constructor	Create a new copy of an object
Copy Assignment	Copy values from one object to another
Move Constructor	Transfer ownership (e.g., std::move)
Move Assignment	Same as above, but after object is created
Destructor	Release memory/resources
Swap	Exchange contents quickly
==, !=	Compare objects logically

🧠 When Should You Write These?
Write all 5 when:

You manage resources (memory, files, sockets)

You want to prevent accidental deep or shallow copies

You want your class to behave like a standard container

🛠️ Want to Practice?
I can guide you through:

Implementing a Buffer class that holds a char*

Adding full Rule of 5 + comparison operators

Writing a benchmark to show copy vs move cost

Integrating it into a small real-world C++ project (e.g., your ADTF tooling)

Would you like to do that next?

🎯 TL;DR of the Chapter in 1 Line
If your class manages a resource (like heap memory), you must control how it copies, moves, assigns, and destroys — or you’ll get bugs, crashes, or performance issues.
